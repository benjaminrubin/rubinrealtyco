		<p>
			When you buy or sell real estate, especially a home, it is likely the biggest investment of your life. In
			going through the buying or selling process, the first step is to separate fact from fiction, and find an
			agent with knowledge and experience and someone you can trust.
		</p>
		<p class="text-center">
			The following are common facts and
			misconceptions about that process:

						<p>
							This, of course, is one of the most important decisions you will make if you are a
							seller.
							As a matter of contract law, when you offer your property for a particular price, you
							are
							not necessarily bound by that. Once you set the price, and it is marketed at that
							amount,
							there will be a buyer or buyers that make an offer. You can accept the offer based on
							the
							terms offered, or you are free to make a counteroffer. It is your acceptance of the
							offer
							that creates the binding agreement, not the offer to purchase from the buyer.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you are a seller, you are hoping for the best possible price. However, it is not the
							seller that establishes the ultimate price, but the market. So, how does one establish
							an
							asking price? A knowledgeable broker will do a market analysis, starting with comparable
							sales. Here she searches for and reviews sales of properties with characteristics
							similar to
							your property in the general geographical area. In most cases, a buyer will not make an
							offer to purchase property that is priced substantially above what the market will bear.
							The
							best approach is to price the property in line with the market, and then let the market
							do
							its work. If you get multiple offers, that does not mean the property was underpriced.
							It
							may mean that the market is heating up, and that is just a trend. If you do not get any
							offers for weeks, or even months, you could safely assume that the property is
							overpriced.
						</p>
						<p></p>
						Some agents will convince you to under price your property in order to get a quick sale, and
						a quick commission. That is not necessarily in the best interests of the seller. Other
						agents may accept a listing for any price the seller demands in order to get the listing.
						You can expect at that price will be above the market price, and you can expect that there
						will be numerous price reductions. However, during that process, you may lose well-qualified
						buyers that that would have made a solid offer at the market price.
						</p>
						<p></p>
						In conclusion, there are many variables and it is best to rely on a broker with knowledge
						and experience who you can trust.

							There is no perfect answer to this question. Each property is different, each property
							is
							unique. There is a range of property condition from tear down to turnkey. The tear down
							property is sold for land value only. Turnkey means you turn the key, and do nothing
							else
							but move in. Your property could be any place in between those extremes. Many buyers are
							looking for a fixer with the idea that they will spend their own money to make repairs
							and
							do remodeling. The price you ask will have to reflect that. Other buyers are looking for
							a
							turnkey property, with no work to be done at all. (Sometimes properties are sold with
							their
							furnishings).
						</p>
						<p>
							The problem with remodeling to achieve a turnkey condition is that you will be
							spending substantial amounts to remodel. You may never recover the amounts you invest in
							remodeling. Also, the finished product may not be to the taste of a prospective buyer.
							That
							applies to everything from remodeling kitchens, bathrooms, to the color of a particular
							tile
							and the design of the faucets. Spending money to remodel property, you must avoid any
							actions that restrict the nature and type of buyers that will be interested in
							purchasing
							your property. Again, each property is different, and that is another reason why you
							must
							work with a broker with knowledge and experience.

						Sorry, but there is no such thing. An agent may focus in your neighborhood, but there is no
						advantage to using an agent with such a limited scope. Truly, an agent should have some
						familiarity with a particular geographical area. However, numbers, data, and statistics do
						not lie. A knowledgeable broker will use his or her experience to evaluate the available
						data to come up with the fair market value. Also, there are common, well-accepted methods of
						publishing and marketing your property that are not unique to any particular agent or area.
						Some might argue that it is more advantageous to retain an agent with a broad scope of
						knowledge. The notion of a neighborhood expert is a common misconception and you should not
						be misled by any such claim.

						The number of sales, even if true, is not a true indicator of the competency of an agent.
						Firstly, the claim may not be true or verifiable. Even if it is, it could mean that that
						particular agent has a bigger budget for self-promotion, or takes listings at over market
						prices in order to get the listing in the first place. A larger sales volume may also mean
						that the particular agent will have less time to spend on your listing. This is true even if
						that agent claims that they are part of a “team” (see below).

					</h2>
				</div>
				<div id="collapseSeven" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingSeven" data-parent="#accordionExample">
					<div class="card-body">
						Not true. In large brokerage firms, agents come and go. The entry-level agents, or those
						with little experience, are usually supervised by agents with more experience. There are
						key, fundamental methods of marketing properties for sale. The large brokers do not have any
						monopoly on those methods. A large brokerage firm may have a large advertising budget, but
						it does not mean that your property will sell any faster or at a higher price. Larger firms
						may not be as efficient as smaller firms. Also, what is the true advantage of an agent
						working with a “team?” Does that mean that he or she lacks the confidence to work alone? How
						are the duties and responsibilities of marketing and selling your property divided, and what
						is the purpose of that division of labor? There is no harm in asking questions. In my
						opinion, you are better off with a smaller, better focused office, such as mine.

						There are no set rules in any aspect of selling. If you are satisfied with the price and
						terms of the first offer, then it may be the best offer. The first offer may come from a
						buyer who has already visited many properties, and is confident that yours is the one he or
						she is seeking. Remember, the offer alone is only the start. Your agent must be able to
						evaluate the terms of each offer, as well as the financial ability of the buyer. That
						particular set of skills will hopefully avoid you wasting time in an escrow that will never
						close. What if you get an all cash offer? This means that you do not have to wait until a
						condition of financing is satisfied. That means the buyer does not have to go looking for a
						loan to buy your property, a process that is often time-consuming. However, each offer must
						stand on its own and your agent must discuss all aspects of an offer, including terms and
						conditions.

						Maybe yes, maybe no. If your house is properly marketed through normal channels, an open
						house may not be necessary. First off, an open house is very intrusive and disruptive to
						your lifestyle. As you may have heard, an open house is probably more advantageous to the
						listing agent who uses it as a way to get prospective buyers for other properties, not
						necessarily yours. Also, there may be health or safety concerns to open houses that you may
						not want to be exposed to. In my experience, if there is a “for sale” sign in front of the
						property in an area where a buyer is looking, that buyer, or his or her agent, can contact
						your agent for an independent showing. That is, of course after the buyer is properly
						qualified by your agent.

					</h2>
				</div>
				<div id="collapseTen" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTen" data-parent="#accordionExample">
					<div class="card-body">
						The easy answer is yes. You need to disclose everything you know about the condition of the
						property, including matters like square footage and whether any remodeling was done with or
						without a permit. The law does not require you to investigate the house, do testing, or to
						disclose things of which you are not aware. You do not want to have a buyer come back after
						you, claiming that there were serious problems with the property that you failed to
						disclose. Aside from disclosing everything you and your agent know, your agent should
						encourage the prospective buyer to obtain an inspection. Or, you can hire an inspection
						company yourself, and disclose that report to any prospective buyer.

							It is true, both sellers and buyers need competent representation. Among other things,
							it is one of the largest investments you will probably ever make. Some agents represent
							both sellers and buyers, and with full disclosure, can avoid a conflict of interest.
							However, as a buyer, you should look for an agent with whom you can communicate. It
							sounds rather obvious, but this consideration is often overlooked. As a buyer, you want
							to get the best property for your money. You will have a checklist of things you’re
							looking for in a property. Those things include the property’s location, size, school
							district, number of bedrooms, etc. (These considerations are numerous and unique to each
							buyer). There is also a reality as to your financial ability. In a typical situation,
							the buyer will put down 20% cash, and bio 80% of the purchase price. Of course, there
							are myriad variations of that formula. It is best if you first contact a mortgage
							broker, and determine what purchase price you can qualify for. Hopefully, you will
							obtain a prequalification letter that will greatly assist any agent to show you
							properties in your price range.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are many considerations that you must address as a buyer. It is impossible to
							anticipate each and every situation that may arise. One example is where you find a
							property like, and then find that someone else beat you to it. You must be able to
							communicate your needs, desires, and abilities to a competent professional who will help
							you achieve your objective.
