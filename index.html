	This, of course, is one of the most important decisions you will make if you are a seller. As a matter of contract law, when you offer your property for a particular price, you are not necessarily bound by that. Once you set the price, and it is marketed at that amount, there will be a buyer or buyers that make an offer. You can accept the offer based on the terms offered, or you are free to make a counteroffer. It is your acceptance of the offer that creates the binding agreement, not the offer to purchase from the buyer.
	
	If you are a seller, you are hoping for the best possible price. However, it is not the seller that establishes the ultimate price, but the market. So, how does one establish an asking price? A knowledgeable broker will do a market analysis, starting with comparable sales. Here she searches for and reviews sales of properties with characteristics similar to your property in the general geographical area. In most cases, a buyer will not make an offer to purchase property that is priced substantially above what the market will bear. The best approach is to price the property in line with the market, and then let the market do its work. If you get multiple offers, that does not mean the property was underpriced. It may mean that the market is heating up, and that is just a trend. If you do not get any offers for weeks, or even months, you could safely assume that the property is overpriced.
	Some agents will convince you to under price your property in order to get a quick sale, and a quick commission. That is not necessarily in the best interests of the seller. Other agents may accept a listing for any price the seller demands in order to get the listing. You can expect at that price will be above the market price, and you can expect that there will be numerous price reductions. However, during that process, you may lose well-qualified buyers that that would have made a solid offer at the market price.
	In conclusion, there are many variables and it is best to rely on a broker with knowledge and experience who you can trust.</p>"

First off, an open house is very intrusive and disruptive to your lifestyle. As you may have heard, an open house is probably more advantageous to the listing agent who uses it as a way to get prospective buyers for other properties, not necessarily yours. Also, there may be health or safety concerns to open houses that you may not want to be exposed to. In my experience, if there is a “for sale” sign in front of the property in an area where a buyer is looking, that buyer, or his or her agent, can contact your agent for an independent showing. That is, of course after the buyer is properly qualified by your agent."

You need to disclose everything you know about the condition of the property, including matters like square footage and whether any remodeling was done with or without a permit. The law does not require you to investigate the house, do testing, or to disclose things of which you are not aware. You do not want to have a buyer come back after you, claiming that there were serious problems with the property that you failed to disclose. Aside from disclosing everything you and your agent know, your agent should encourage the prospective buyer to obtain an inspection. Or, you can hire an inspection company yourself, and disclose that report to any prospective buyer."

		<p>
			When you buy or sell real estate, especially a home, it is likely the biggest investment of your life. In
			going through the buying or selling process, the first step is to separate fact from fiction, and find an
			agent with knowledge and experience and someone you can trust.

						particular set of skills will hopefully avoid you wasting time in an escrow that will never
						close. What if you get an all cash offer? This means that you do not have to wait until a
						condition of financing is satisfied. That means the buyer does not have to go looking for a
						loan to buy your property, a process that is often time-consuming. However, each offer must stand on its own and your real estate agent must discuss all aspects of an offer, including terms and
						conditions.

						Maybe yes, maybe no. If your house is properly marketed through normal channels, an open
						house may not be necessary. First off, an open house is very intrusive and disruptive to
						your lifestyle. As you may have heard, an open house is probably more advantageous to the
						listing agent who uses it as a way to get prospective buyers for other properties, not
						necessarily yours. Also, there may be health or safety concerns to open houses that you may
						not want to be exposed to. In my experience, if there is a “for sale” sign in front of the
						property in an area where a buyer is looking, that buyer, or his or her agent, can contact
						your agent for an independent showing. That is, of course after the buyer is properly
						qualified by your agent.

						The easy answer is yes. You need to disclose everything you know about the condition of the
						property, including matters like square footage and whether any remodeling was done with or
						without a permit. The law does not require you to investigate the house, do testing, or to
						disclose things of which you are not aware. You do not want to have a buyer come back after
						you, claiming that there were serious problems with the property that you failed to
						disclose. Aside from disclosing everything you and your agent know, your agent should
						encourage the prospective buyer to obtain an inspection. Or, you can hire an inspection
						company yourself, and disclose that report to any prospective buyer.

						Not really. There are multiple websites that can give you insight into the market. The
						multiple listing service, or “MLS,” is a powerful tool available to member agents. Since you
						are hiring an agent, you must let him or her do the “heavy lifting” in doing a market survey
						and market analysis. Of course, you should do some preliminary checking yourself, but in the
						final analysis, you are selling an asset with enormous value, and you want to get it right

							It is true, both sellers and buyers need competent representation. Among other things,
							it is one of the largest investments you will probably ever make. Some agents represent
							both sellers and buyers, and with full disclosure, can avoid a conflict of interest.
							However, as a buyer, you should look for an agent with whom you can communicate. It
							sounds rather obvious, but this consideration is often overlooked. As a buyer, you want
							to get the best property for your money. You will have a checklist of things you’re
							looking for in a property. Those things include the property’s location, size, school
							district, number of bedrooms, etc. (These considerations are numerous and unique to each
							buyer). There is also a reality as to your financial ability. In a typical situation,
							the buyer will put down 20% cash, and bio 80% of the purchase price. Of course, there
							are myriad variations of that formula. It is best if you first contact a mortgage
							broker, and determine what purchase price you can qualify for. Hopefully, you will
							obtain a prequalification letter that will greatly assist any agent to show you
							properties in your price range.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are many considerations that you must address as a buyer. It is impossible to
							anticipate each and every situation that may arise. One example is where you find a
							property like, and then find that someone else beat you to it. You must be able to
							communicate your needs, desires, and abilities to a competent professional who will help
							you achieve your objective.

						Good question. A lot of the same considerations apply to the purchase or sale of commercial
						property. To start off with, most sellers and buyers of commercial property have more
						experience in real estate. Nonetheless, each buyer and seller is unique, and each property
